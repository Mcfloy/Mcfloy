Hello I'm @Mcfloy. I'm currently a Fullstack dev (Angular/Java) but I'd love to work more on Rust projects. 
- 👋 French developer living near Lille
- 👀 I’m interested in Rust and Go
- 🌱 I’m not learning anything for now but last thing I learnt was gRPC.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate but should be a Rust/Go related project, still a junior. 
- 📫 How to reach me: you can email me at lucas.perreau@leansys.fr

My projects (so far):
- vault-credentials: WIP but stable for my own usage. You can use it as a Rust alternative of Spring Cloud Vault.
- gde-frontend: Abandonned but was using Angular.
- yew-spotify: Probably abandonned as the framework (Yew) that I'm using is evolving and I'm waiting for it to rebuild the app in a better way. It was also a good reason to use a front-end rust framework.
- hermes: Never started it as my technical stack wasn't ready yet. At the beginning I thought I would use Typescript and now I'll want to use gRPC to make the app. The idea of hermes was to create a "reddit/snapchat" app that would allow users to create topics of 60 seconds or 60 minutes, with upvotes and downvotes and automatic removal of content after expired time.
- subreddit: Abandonned but should work fine.
- Master-Yies: A participation to the Riot Challenge 2016 that was really cool, the concept was to put your summoner name and having an algorithm guessing which lane you preferred. An additional feature was added that would let an algorithm decides which lane you should go based on the summoners in your team. 
- audio-visualizer/circular-clock: HTML5 projects playing with the canvas API. Pretty cool but nothing too serious about it.
