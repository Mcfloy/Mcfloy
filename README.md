Hello I'm @Mcfloy. I'm currently a back-end developer (Scala) but I would love to work more on Rust projects. 
- 👋 French developer living near Lille
- 👀 I’m interested in Rust and Go
- 🌱 I’m learning how to create a good GRPC HATEOAS equivalent.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate but should be a Rust/Go related project, still a junior. 
- 📫 How to reach me: you can email me at lucas.perreau@leansys.fr
