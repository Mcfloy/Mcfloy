Hello I'm @Mcfloy. I'm a full-stack dev (Angular/Java) but I'd love to work more on Rust projects. Y 
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mcfloy
- 👀 I’m interested in Rust
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Rust with Warp and otherwise frameworks around it.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate but if it was the case, it should be a Rust related project (very cool if it's about the event driven data paradigm) 
- 📫 How to reach me: you can email me at lucas.perreau@leansys.fr
